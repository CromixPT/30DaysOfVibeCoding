# Day 1 – Building a Mood Tracker

## Context

Goal: Build the foundation of a simple Mood Tracker using Blazor in Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot.

## Why a Mood Tracker?

- **Simple interaction** – Users click one of a few mood options (happy, sad, excited, tired, etc.).
- **Engaging & personal** – Immediate visual feedback (icons / colors) encourages reflection.
- **Covers core Blazor concepts** – Event handling, component state, conditional rendering, layout.
- **Naturally extensible** – Future additions: history, notes, charts, persistence, API sync.
- **Great for AI assistance** – Clear, UI-centric tasks for Copilot to suggest components and patterns.

## Basic Functionality (Day 1 Scope)

- Render a set of mood buttons / emoji.
- Store currently selected mood in component state.
- Display the active mood (text + icon) after selection.
- Apply basic styling to highlight the chosen mood.

## Stretch Ideas

- Mood history (per day / per session).
- Add a note or short reflection tied to the mood.
- Local storage persistence.
- Chart of moods over time.
- API backend (later days).

## Challenges

> To fill after reflection

## Lessons Learned

- Discovered theres many templates for instructions both for [CoPilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) and for [Cursor](https://cursor.directory/)
