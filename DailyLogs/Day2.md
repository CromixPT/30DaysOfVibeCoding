# Day 1 â€“ Building a Mood Tracker

## Context

### Goal

- Refine the UI to make it look like Google Calendar with toggle to month, week, daily views

## Challenges

- The lack of my knowledge about UI terms makes this a bit more difficult. While models do a nice job of taking natural language and providing interesting results, the fact is that when specific terms are provided, results are more successful.

## Lessons Learned

- Specifics matter, when being vague the results can be the oposite of what you expect
