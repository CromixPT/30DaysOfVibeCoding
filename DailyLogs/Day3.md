# Day 3

**Today we had two goals:**

1. Add real persistence with a SQLite DB managed by EF.
2. Get hold of a designer friend to build a small, simple design so I can feed it to the model and see if it gets there.

But since I couldn‚Äôt get a hold of a designer for more polished designs, we will focus on adding persistence with a real DB and might try some charts‚Äîlet‚Äôs see how it goes.

Kicked off with the following prompt:

```jsx
Let's add persistence into a database.
We will use a SQLite database and EF to manage it. Add a repository implementation using EF.
Let's also add a data access object class to represent the database entry of the MoodEntry. It should contain all the information and add createdAt, updatedAt, and deletedAt.
```

Copilot got it almost right on the first try; it even enforced a query filter:

```csharp
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        var e = modelBuilder.Entity<MoodEntryEntity>();
        e.HasKey(x => x.Id);
        e.Property(x => x.MoodKey).HasMaxLength(64).IsRequired();
        e.Property(x => x.MoodName).HasMaxLength(128).IsRequired();
        e.Property(x => x.Emoji).HasMaxLength(8).IsRequired();
        e.Property(x => x.Sentiment).HasMaxLength(32).IsRequired();
        e.Property(x => x.Emotion).HasMaxLength(64);
        e.Property(x => x.Message).HasMaxLength(1024);
        e.HasIndex(x => x.TimestampUtc);
        e.HasQueryFilter(x => x.DeletedAt == null); // Global soft-delete filter.
    }
```

I said ‚Äúalmost,‚Äù because I did not like that it had placed everything in a Services folder.

So I asked for them to be moved.

A human usually does this via drag-and-drop. AI does not; it writes new files with new namespaces, creates namespace chaos, and struggles to remove the old files.

The second time I asked, I got the class implementation changed to this:

```csharp
// Duplicate EF repository relocated to Infrastructure. This placeholder remains to avoid compile issues
// if any lingering using directives reference MoodTracker.Services.EfMoodEntryRepository.
// Safe to delete once all references updated.
namespace MoodTracker.Services;
internal static class EfRepositoryPlaceholder { }
```

On the third time I requested it:

**üí° Learning moment: Delete them yourself!**

After dealing with this, I asked to change the data seeding approach, but I don‚Äôt quite like the way it‚Äôs done:

```csharp
// Apply pending migrations then perform initial seed (development / first-run).
using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
{
    var db = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<MoodTrackerDbContext>();
    await db.Database.MigrateAsync();
    var logger = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILoggerFactory>().CreateLogger("StartupSeed");
    await SeedData.EnsureSeedAsync(db, logger);
}
```

I questioned Copilot about whether this was the best approach and said I‚Äôd rather avoid creating a scope/service provider like this.

It started looping between using an `IDbContextFactory<MoodTrackerDbContext>` for both seeding and the repository, and going back to creating a scope.

At this point, I opted to ignore seeding and just move forward; it‚Äôs not usually something you do for a production service anyway.

I have to say that the code produced looks good for a throwaway service‚Ä¶ For example, to load a month‚Äôs view, it fires at least 30 queries into the database‚Äîone for each day.

We can do better than this, can‚Äôt we, AI?

The question that needs to be raised here is: what if I did not have this awareness? This code would go into a working application that, as soon as it reached a decent number of users, would put a lot of pressure on its database.

**üí° Don‚Äôt trust blindly‚Ä¶ Review each step, not just the end results**

I asked for optimizations‚Ä¶

```jsx
Let's optimize these queries and data access patterns.
If we are loading a month's worth of data, let's not do 30 queries‚Äîoptimize this for performance on both application and database side.
Same for week view; the only query that should target a single day is when the user selects that day.
```

It understood the request, created a ranged query, and even used the index properly:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Return all entries whose UTC timestamp falls within the inclusive <paramref name="fromUtc"/> (>=) and exclusive <paramref name="toUtc"/> (<) range.
/// Caller is responsible for any grouping/ordering beyond the returned default ordering (newest first).
/// </summary>
/// <param name="fromUtc">Inclusive range start (UTC).</param>
/// <param name="toUtc">Exclusive range end (UTC).</param>
/// <remarks>
/// Added to eliminate N+1 query patterns when loading week/month calendar views. Optimizes database round-trips by fetching a contiguous block in one query.
/// </remarks>
Task<IReadOnlyList<MoodEntry>> GetRangeAsync(DateTime fromUtc, DateTime toUtc, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
```

After this, I decided it was good enough. Let‚Äôs keep in mind this is our first attempt in the series; I don‚Äôt want to set the bar too high.

I started moving toward the dashboards, trying a new approach with smaller instructions:

‚ÄúCreate a new page called dashboards and add it on the menu.‚Äù

From here on, it was a series of small-step instructions and refinements, and using the correct terms, the results were successful and gradually built the dashboards page.


**üí° Again, smaller instructions worked better than big requests**

What I liked most was that each chart was built as its own component, providing reusability and modularity.

At the same time, what I disliked most was that it custom-built the chart implementations instead of using a library. But I never asked for that, so it stuck to the instructions.

This wraps it up for today, and honestly, I will wrap up this mood tracker too.

Not because of what we could still do here to tweak and improve the UI and performance, but because I want to start from scratch with an application that can grow with more functionality and purpose, rather than features that no one cares about.
