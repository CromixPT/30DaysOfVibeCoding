# Day 3 â€“ Building a Mood Tracker

### Goal

- Add database persistance with sqlLite db and entity framework
- Add dashboard page with charts

## Challenges

- Optiizations on the performance are hard to get right with AI
- Revisions on every step of code changes is a different paradigm, each change affects not just the highlighted lines but also impact other pieces.

## Lessons Learned

- I have been taking this of having an AI Agent doing code as I would look into work done from another developer, in the sense that I would just review it at the end, on the PR. This is very wrong, AI needs validation and verification at every step, and if I don't know what its doing I need to research it.
